Path Ids are a way to create a link to a document or a part of a document without knowing what the final path will be. This allows the final path to change, either by changing the output location, or by simply taking a subsection and turning it into a separate document. It also relieves the burden of the author of having to correctly type the path, and allowing them instead to focus on what they want to link to.

How to use document Ids to create links is [given later](<!-- (dl (get-path doc-link)) -->) within this document.

There are a couple of ways to define path ids based on what you want to identify.
