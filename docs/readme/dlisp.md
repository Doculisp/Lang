<!-- (dl
(section-meta
    (title Native Doculisp Files)
    (id dlisp)
)
) -->

If you have a file that contains only Doculisp code blocks without any markdown you can simplify that file. By changing the extension from `.md` to `.dlisp` you can remove the html comments and the opening `(dl` to contain raw Doculisp code.

<!-- (dl (# Example)) -->

```markdown
<!--
(dl
    (section-meta
        (title Doculisp)
        (include
            (Version ./version.md)
            (Intro ./why.md)
            (Language ./structure.md)
            (Recognition ./contributors.md)
        )
    )
)
-->

<!-- (dl (# Table of Contents)) -->

<!-- (dl (content (toc))) -->
```

Can be simplified to:

```doculisp
(section-meta
    (title Doculisp)
    (include
        (Version ./version.md)
        (Intro ./why.md)
        (Language ./structure.md)
        (Recognition ./contributors.md)
    )
)

(# Table of contents)

(content (toc))
```
